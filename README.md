## ðŸ”¥Firebase

 Open `Firebase.js` file from under `src/` folder and replace the `firebaseConfig` object

 **Enable Firebase Authentication**

**Enable Firebase Database**

- Open the Firebase console
- Navigate to *Develop* > *Database* > *Realtime Database* > *Create database*
- For testing purposes select *Start in test mode* then click on *enable*

**Enhance security rules**

We want to allow only authenticated users to write in the DB, except for the `/meetings/:meetingId/:userId/attendees` path section, where anybody will be able to write, since we want users to register.

- Open the Firebase console
- Navigate to *Develop* > *Database* > *Rules*
- Paste the following rule then *Publish* it.

```
{
    "rules": {
        ".read": true,
        ".write": "auth!=null",
          "meetings": {
              "$meetingId": {
                  "$userId": {
                      "attendees": {
                          ".write": true
                      }
                  }
              }
          }
    }
}
```
Where:

 - `".write": "auth!=null"` - meaning only authenticated users can write to the DB
 - We want to allow unauthenticated users to write to the `/meetings/:meetingId/:userId/attendees`

You can also simulate the *path* using the *Simulator*.
